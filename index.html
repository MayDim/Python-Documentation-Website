        <header>Hello World</header>
        <article>
          <p>If you're new to Python, the first program you typically write is the classic "Hello, World!" program. It's a simple way to verify that your Python environment is set up correctly and that you can run Python code. Here's how to do it:</p>
          <pre>
            <code> print("Hello, World!")</code>
          </pre>
            <p>Open a text editor or Python IDE, create a new file, paste the code above, and save it with a ".py" file extension (e.g., "hello.py").</p>
            <p>To run the program, open your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved the file, and type the following command:</p>
    
          <pre>
            <code> python hello.py</code>
          </pre>

          <p>You should see "Hello, World!" printed to the screen. Congratulations, you've just run your first Python program!</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
         <p>In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. Unlike many other programming languages, you don't need to declare a data type when creating a variable. Python determines the data type automatically based on the assigned value. Here's how variables work in Python:</p>
    
        <pre>
          <code>
                # Variable assignment
                name = "John"
                age = 30
                height = 175.5

                # Printing variable values
                print("Name:", name)
                print("Age:", age)
                print("Height:", height)

                # Variable reassignment
                name = "Alice"
                age = 25

                # Updated values
                print("Updated Name:", name)
                print("Updated Age:", age)
          </code>
      </pre>

          <p>As shown in the example above, you can create variables and assign values to them. Python's dynamic typing allows you to change the value and data type of a variable later in the code. This flexibility makes Python easy to work with for various types of data.</p>      
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope"> 
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <article>
    <p>In Python, variable scope defines where a variable is accessible and can be used within your code. There are two main types of variable scope:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Global Scope:</h3>
    <p>Variables defined outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in your code, both inside and outside functions.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Local Scope:</h3>
    <p>Variables defined within a function have local scope. They are only accessible within that specific function. Attempting to access them outside of the function will result in an error.</p>
    
    <p>Here's a simple example to illustrate variable scope:</p>
    
    <h3>Python Code:</h3>
    <pre>
<code>
# Global variable
global_var = "I'm a global variable"

def my_function():
    # Local variable
    local_var = "I'm a local variable"
    print(global_var)  # Accessing the global variable
    print(local_var)   # Accessing the local variable

my_function()

# Attempting to access the local variable outside the function will result in an error.
# print(local_var)  # Uncommenting this line will cause an error.
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>Understanding variable scope is crucial for managing data effectively in your Python programs. Variables declared in different scopes serve various purposes and have different lifetimes.</p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
           <p>In Python, constants are variables whose values should not be modified once they are set. While Python doesn't have a strict concept of constants like some other languages, it uses naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. By convention, constant names are usually written in uppercase letters.</p>

    <p>Here's an example of defining a constant in Python:</p>

    <pre>
<code>
# Define a constant (by convention, use uppercase letters)
PI = 3.14159265
RADIUS = 5

# Calculate the area of a circle
area = PI * (RADIUS ** 2)

print("The area of the circle is:", area)
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>While Python doesn't enforce the immutability of constants, following the naming convention and treating variables in uppercase as constants is a good practice to make your code more readable and to signal to other developers that a variable's value should remain unchanged.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <article>
           <p>Data types in Python represent the kind of data that a variable can hold. Python supports various built-in data types, and understanding them is crucial for working with data effectively. Some common data types in Python include:</p>
    
    <h4>1. Integers (int):</h4>
    <p>Integers are whole numbers without a fractional part, such as -3, 0, and 42.</p>
    
    <h4>2. Floating-Point Numbers (float):</h4>
    <p>Floats represent real numbers with a decimal point, like 3.14 or -0.5.</p>
    
    <h4>3. Strings (str):</h4>
    <p>Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes, e.g., "Hello, World!"</p>
    
    <h4>4. Lists:</h4>
    <p>Lists are ordered collections of items. They can contain a mix of different data types.</p>
    
    <h4>5. Dictionaries:</h4>
    <p>Dictionaries are key-value pairs used to store data in an associative manner.</p>
    
    <h4>6. Booleans (bool):</h4>
    <p>Booleans represent either True or False, used for logical operations.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="If...Else_Statement">
        <header>If...Else Statement</header>
        <article>
          <p>The <code>if-else</code> statement in Python is used for decision-making. It allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
          </p>

          <h4>Syntax:</h4>

          <pre>
            <code>
              if condition:
              # Code to be executed if the condition is true
              else:
              # Code to be executed if the condition is false
            </code>
          </pre>

          <h4>Example:</h4>

          <p>Consider the following example where we check if a number is even or odd:
          </p>

          <pre>
          <code>
          # Get user input
          num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

          # Check if the number is even or odd
          if num % 2 == 0:
              print(f"{num} is an even number.")
          else:
              print(f"{num} is an odd number.")
          </code>
          </pre>

          <p>In this example, the <code>if</code> statement checks if the remainder of the division of <code>num</code> by 2 is 0. If true, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.
          </p>

        <header>While Statement</header>
        <article>
              <p>The <code>while</code> loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
              </p>

              <h4>Syntax:</h4>

              <pre>
              <code>
              while condition:
                  # Code to be executed while the condition is true
              </code>
              </pre>

              <h4>Example:</h4>

              <p>
                  Consider the following example where we print numbers from 1 to 5 using a <code>while</code> loop:
              </p>

              <pre>
              <code>
              # Initialize a counter
              counter = 1

              # Print numbers from 1 to 5
              while counter <= 5:
                  print(counter)
                  counter += 1
              </code>
              </pre>

              <p>
          In this example, the <code>while</code> loop continues to execute as long as the <code>counter</code> is less than or equal to 5. It prints the current value of the counter and increments it in each iteration.

          <p>
              In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It helps in organizing code and makes it more modular and readable.
          </p>

          <h4>Syntax:</h4>

          <pre>
          <code>
          def function_name(parameters):
              # Code to be executed
              # ...
              return result
          </code>
          </pre>

          <h4>Example:</h4>

          <p>Consider the following example of a function that adds two numbers:
          </p>

          <pre>
          <code>
          # Function declaration
          def add_numbers(a, b):
              # Code to add two numbers
              result = a + b
              return result

          # Function call
          sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)
          print(f"The sum is: {sum_result}")
          </code>
          </pre>

          <p>In this example, the <code>add_numbers</code> function takes two parameters (<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>), adds them, and returns the result. The function is then called with arguments 5 and 3, and the result is printed.
